"I looked and looked at her, and I knew, as clearly as I know that I will die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth. She was only the dead-leaf echo of the nymphet from long ago - but I loved her, this Lolita, pale and polluted and big with another man's child. She could fade and wither - I didn't care. I would still go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of her face."

― Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita

我望着她，望了又望。一生一世，全心全意。我最爱的是她，可以肯定，就像自己必死一样肯定。当日的如花妖女，现在只剩下枯叶回乡。苍白，混俗，臃肿，腹中是别人的骨肉。但我爱她。她可以褪色，可以萎谢，怎样都可以。但我只要看她一眼，万般柔情，涌上心头。
——弗拉基米尔 · 纳博科夫《洛丽塔》
